# TDA_DeepL_TimeSeries
In this repository i will apply time series classification via topological data analysis in different data sets

CNNBetti.py is the most important file here. The purpose of this repository is to use topological data analysis to classify *several* data sets, so i made the functions needed for it, so every new file will be only the important part, the analysis.
